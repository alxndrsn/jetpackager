Notes on .jpn files, and template.jpn in particular.
--------------------------------------------------
ENCODING: .jpn files are encoded with UTF-16LE
--------------------------------------------------
.jpn files consist of a number of named sections, each started by the section name in square brackets.
A section is terminated by the beginning of the next section.  The sections contain two kinds of entries,
one an XML-like structure, the other, lines beginning with !.

Sections:

[Session]
[ProfileVersions]
[DeploymentSet]
[Package]
[Session2]
[Infrastructure]
[PackageInfo]
--------------------------------------------------
Substitution variables

The following variables will be substituted into the template.jpn.
They are specified as ${variableNameHere}

packContent				<folder> and <file> content of the package
resourcepath			<resourcepath> content of executable
executableName			the name of the executable
workingDirectory		the path of the working directory
productDescription		description of the product used when making a Windows shortcut
--------------------------------------------------
[Session]
This section contains details of the current session of JetPackII.  It doesn't look particularly useful except
to allow you to re-open a .jpn in JetPackII and have your settings restored.

Sample:
!jetversion "6.00"
!root "C:\dev\workspace-32bit\JetPackager\temp\pack"
!lastPage 8
!keepArchive true
!trialrunFolder ".\FrontlineSMS_trial_run"
!skipTrialRun false
!alwaysClearTrialRunDir false


[ProfileVersions]
This seems to detail the environment that jet should use.

Sample:
<jetProfile "v1"
    !binCompStr "1.6.0_03"
    !profile "1.6.0_03"
    !jetVersion 6 0 4 ""
>end //jetProfile


[DeploymentSet]
This contains a list of all files that will be present in the final installer package.
Everything is contained within the <root> section:
<folder "$(Root)" 0 0 4
>end //folder

Foders are detailed:
  <folder "${name}" ${permissions}
  >end //folder
  
Files are detailed by:
  <file 
  		!basic_info "${name}" "${localPath}"
  		!flags ${permissions}
  		!cachedLastModified ${dateLastModified [javaTimestamp] L}
  		!attributes ${not sure what this is...}
  >end //file

There is also a <resourcePath> section which specifies all non-RT JARs to be compiled into the
executable:
  <resourcepath
      !entry 3 "C:\dev\excelsior\jet6.0-pro\activation-1.1.jar" null
      // ... more here
      !entry 3 "C:\dev\excelsior\jet6.0-pro\xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar" null
  >end //resourcepath

[Package]
This section contains details of the Java runtime that should be included in the package.
It also contains details of where the project should be installed to, the name of the start
menu group to put shortcuts in etc. 

[Session2]
This contains details of the trial run and which native libraries were loaded.  There's a good
chance that these settings affect optimization and the libraries that are included in the package.

[Infrastructure]
This includes details of where to sintall shortcuts, what files to associate with the program,
and post-install actions.

[PackageInfo]
This contains even more details of the package and the files which will be included in it.
It also contains details of the compression algorithm to use.
