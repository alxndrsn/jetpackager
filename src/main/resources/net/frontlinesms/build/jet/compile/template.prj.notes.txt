Notes on .prj files and template.prj in particular
In this file, lines that should be added to a .prj file are specified starting with a pipe and a space.
--------------------------------------------------
Should have a USG (usage) file specified in .prj, e.g.:
| !module ./XXX.usg
There may be a commandline tool for generating the .usg file.
--------------------------------------------------
Substitution variables:
These are specified as ${variableNameHere}

jpn.path					Path to the JPN file.  Is this the path to create at?  Or is the .jpn required at this point?
java.mainClass				The main java class to run
outputName					The file name of the built executable
splashImage.path 			The path to the splash image
versionInfo.companyName		Company name, as used in version info
versionInfo.fileDescription	The name of the project, as used in version info.  This is used for the Windows shortcut in the start menu.
versionInfo.copyright.year	The year of the copyright, as used in version info
versionInfo.copyright.owner The owner of the copyright, as used in version info
versionInfo.productName		The product name, as used in version info
versionInfo.number			The actual version number.  I think it's expected in single-digit W.X.Y.Z.  I've seen 1.6.08 truncated to 1.6.
							Entering a bad version number will lead to the compile failing to produce any output.

To specify directories of JARs to use on the classpath:
